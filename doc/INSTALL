jarvis documentation - INSTALL

To make things easy, jarvis comes with a installer that initializes the
database and copies the files to the right location, which is '/opt/jarvis'.

The complete directory view would look like this:

/opt/jarvis/
|
|-> agents/         (the place where all the agents are stored)
|-> doc/            (the place you are currently in, documentation)
|-> jarvis          (the main program, daemon if you want)
|-> jarvis_report   (reporting tool to get pdf reports)
|-> install_jarvis  (the installer)
|-> jarvis.db       (the sqlite database)
|-> jarvis.conf     (the configuration file)
 -> ....            (README, TODO, AUTHORS, ...)

By executing install_jarvis as superuser, this should be the resulting directory
tree. Additionally the installer adds the user 'jarvis' to /etc/passwd.

Once the installer is finished, you can switch over to the jarvis user (which has
/opt/jarvis as home directory) and execute ./jarvis. But you should have a look at
the config (jarvis.conf) before doing so. Additionally there is a documentation 
about the config (-> CONFIGURATION).

jarvis documentation - CONFIGURATION

So you managed to install jarvis? Good!

The next step is the configuration which is pretty simple and straightforward.
One agent is one line in the config (jarvis.conf). For example, to install an agent
that monitors if another machine is reachable on port 80 every 10 seconds, you would 
write this line into jarvis.conf:

agent=[TCPConnect,"tcp_check_80",10,google.at,80]

That's it! Wasn't too hard to get, right?

But wait, what happens if the host isn't reachable? Well, at first: nothing.
You have to tell jarvis what to do if errors occur. This behaviour is somewhat
different from other projects you maybe know. The word we are looking for here
is 'triggers'. A trigger is an action you define in the configuration. Confused?
Let's look at an example. We will use the previously activated agent from below 
and add some action now. For this example we want that a mail is sent after the
host is not reachable 5 times in 60 seconds:

trigger=['trigger_1',"tcp_check_80",5,60,/tmp/mailscript]
